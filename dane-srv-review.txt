CONSOLIDATED FEEDBACK FROM VIKTOR DUKHOVNI

[ I'm splitting it into a few messages to keep it manageable, and
  in any case some of my comments are still pencil marks on a
  print-out, not yet transcribed. ]

This message covers that abstract and introduction.

General comment:

    The draft frequently talks about "hostnames", where what is
    really meant is a transport endpoint (port, transport protocol,
    host).  With PKIX-EE or DANE-EE certificate usages, TLSA records
    are more precise than the Web PKI and can associate different,
    non-interchangeable key material with distinct services on a
    single host.  So in many places I will be suggesting replacing
    statements about "hostnames" with statements about "transport
    endpoints".

1. Abstract:

    General comment, not just certificates, but also public keys, or
    more simply "key material".  The new version is also more compact.

  OLD:

    <t>The DANE specification (RFC 6698) describes how to use TLSA
     resource records in the DNS to associate a server's host name with
     its TLS certificate, where the association is secured with DNSSEC.
     However, application protocols that use SRV records (RFC 2782) to indirectly
     name the target server host names for a service domain cannot apply
     the rules from RFC 6698. Therefore this document provides guidelines
     that enable such protocols to locate and use TLSA records.</t>

  NEW:

    <t>
     The DANE specification (RFC 6698) describes how to use DNSSEC
     secured TLSA resource records to associate a transport endpoint
     with corresponding TLS key material.  This document builds on
     RFC 6698 to specify DANE for application protocols that use SRV
     records (RFC 2782) to indirectly locate the transport endpoints
     associated with a given service at a service domain.
    </t>

2.  Introduction first two paragraphs:

    Align with similar language in the abstract, deal with hostname
    versus transport endpoint.  More concise.

  OLD:

    <t>The base DANE specification <xref target="RFC6698"/> describes
     how to use TLSA resource records in the DNS to associate a
     server's host name with its TLS certificate, where the association is
     secured using DNSSEC. That document "only relates to securely
     associating certificates for TLS and DTLS with host names" (see
     the last paragraph of section 1.2 of
     <xref target="RFC6698"/>).</t>
 
    <t>Some application protocols do not use host names directly; instead,
     they use a service domain, and the relevant target server host names are located
     indirectly via SRV records <xref target="RFC2782"/>.
     Because of this intermediate resolution step, the normal DANE rules
     specified in <xref target="RFC6698"/> cannot be applied to
     protocols that use SRV records. (Rules for SMTP
     <xref target='RFC5321'/>, which uses MX records instead of SRV records,
     are described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-dane-smtp-with-dane"/>.)</t>

  New:

    <t>
     The base DANE specification <xref target="RFC6698"/> describes
     how to use DNSSEC <xref target="RFC4033"/> secured TLSA resource
     records to associate a transport endpoint with corresponding
     TLS key material.  Some application protocols locate transport
     endpoints indirectly via SRV records <xref target="RFC2782"/>.
     As a result of this indirection, the rules specified in <xref
     target="RFC6698"/> cannot be applied verbatim to protocols that
     use SRV records. (Rules for SMTP <xref target='RFC5321'/>, which
     uses MX records instead of SRV records, are described in <xref
     target="I-D.ietf-dane-smtp-with-dane"/>.)
    </t>

2.  Introduction summary:

    The most notable clarification below is that TLS is only
    mandatory, for a given transport endpoint, when DNSSEC validated
    TLSA records are present, whether usable or not.  If at least
    one record is usable, the peer must be authenticated.

    If referencing OPS creates timing difficulties, because (for
    some reason not clear to me) OPS is being held back relative
    to SMTP and SRV, detailed CNAME language can be found in
    the SMTP draft (modulo MX<->SRV substitution).

Add to references:

  OLD:
 
      <t>We rely on DNSSEC to secure the association between the
       service domain and the target server host names (i.e., the
       host names that are discovered by the SRV query).</t>
 
      <t>The TLSA records are located using the port, protocol, and
       target server host name fields (not the service domain).</t>
 
      <t>Clients always use TLS when connecting to servers with TLSA
       records.</t>
 
      <t>Assuming that the association is secure, the server's
       certificate is expected to authenticate the target server host
       name, rather than the service domain.</t>

  NEW:

      <t>
       We rely on DNSSEC to secure SRV records that map the desired
       service, transport protocol and service domain to corresponding
       target transport endpoints (i.e., the host names and ports
       that are returned in the SRV records).
      </t>
 
      <t>
       TLSA records for each transport endpoint are located using
       the target port, tranport protocol, and target host name.  In
       particular, TLSA records are not located directly via the
       service domain.
      </t>
 
      <t>
       When DNSSEC validated TLSA records are published for a
       particular transport endpoint, and the endpoint supports both
       cleartext and TLS communication, clients SHOULD use TLS when
       connecting to that endpoint.
      </t>

      <t>
       When at least one TLSA record is usable, the server's
       certificate or public key MUST match at least one of the
       usable TLSA records.  The primary reference identity for
       peername checks is the TLSA base domain (generally the target
       host name) with the service domain also supported for
       compatibility with legacy deployments.  Additional acceptable
       peer names may arise as a result of CNAME expansion of either
       the service domain or (if supported) the target hostname.
       See <xref target="I-D.ietf-dane-ops"/> for details.

This message covers sections 2 ("Terminology") and 3.1 ("SRV Query").

General comment (copied verbatim from abstract and introduction
feedback):

    The draft frequently talks about "hostnames", where what is
    really meant is a transport endpoint (port, transport protocol,
    host).  With PKIX-EE or DANE-EE certificate usages, TLSA records
    are more precise than the Web PKI and can associate different,
    non-interchangeable key material with distinct services on a
    single host.  So in many places I will be suggesting replacing
    statements about "hostnames" with statements about "transport
    endpoints".

2. Terminology:

    General comment, this section is a bit too short I think.  More
    terms should perhaps be defined.  I will propose a not necessarily
    comprehensive list.

    Add a suitable definition of "transport endpoint" (or some
    other name if the imprecision noted below is objectionable):

        Transport Endpoint:  In this document, a triple which combines

           * A DNS hostname which abstracts a set of IPv4 and/or
             IPv6 addresses.
           * A transport protocol (TCP or UDP)
           * A port number which specifies a TCP or UDP service
             deployed at the addresses associated with the hostname.

        DANE TLSA records associate key material with transport
        endpoints.  Because this definition of a transport endpoint
        uses a hostname and not a network address, strictly speaking
        what we have is an indirect reference to a set of related TCP
        or UDP endpoints.

    Likely a good idea to paste in some relevant definitions from the SRV
    RFCs (e.g. "service domain").

Section 3.1 "SRV Query" first paragraph, bottom of page 3/top of
page 4 (refine the words "helpful summary"):

  OLD:

    <t>When the client makes an SRV query, a successful result will
     typically be a list of one or more SRV records (or possibly a chain of
     CNAME / DNAME aliases leading to such a list).  Implementers need to
     be aware that unsuccessful results can occur because of various
     DNS-related errors; a helpful summary can be found in section 2.1 of
     <xref target="I-D.ietf-dane-smtp-with-dane"/>.</t>

  New:

    <t>When the client makes an SRV query, a successful result will
     typically be a list of one or more SRV records (or possibly a chain of
     CNAME / DNAME aliases leading to such a list).  Implementers need to
     be aware that unsuccessful results can occur because of various
     DNS-related errors; guidance on avoiding downgrade attacks can be found
     in section 2.1 of <xref target="I-D.ietf-dane-smtp-with-dane"/>.</t>

Next paragraph (since the terminology section claims definitions
of "secure", ...  from 4035, quote from 4035, not 4033).  Be more
precise about aliases.  I think the text about the AD bit is should
either be deleted or expanded (a lot), the application may be doing
its own validation, and the AD is the irrelevant, or some discussion
is needed about when AD-bits might be trustworthy.

  OLD:

    <t>For this specification to apply, the entire DNS RRset that is
     returned MUST be "secure" according to DNSSSEC validation
     (<xref target="RFC4033"/> section 5).  In the case of aliases, the
     whole chain of CNAME and DNAME RRsets MUST be secure as well.
     This corresponds to the AD bit being set in the response(s); see
     <xref target="RFC4035"/> section 3.2.3.</t>

  NEW:

    <t>For this specification to apply, the entire DNS RRset that is
     returned MUST be "secure" according to DNSSSEC validation
     (<xref target="RFC4035"/> section 4.3).  In case the answer is
     obtained via a chain of CNAME and/or DNAME aliases, the
     whole chain of CNAME and DNAME RRsets MUST also be secure.

Next paragraph (number 3 of section 3.1)
 
  Again drop AD-bit discussion and improve wording.

  OLD:

    <t>If the the entire RRset is "insecure", this protocol has
     not been correctly deployed.  The client SHOULD fall back to
     its non-DNSSEC, non-DANE behavior (this corresponds to the AD
     bit being unset).  If the entire RRset is "bogus", the client
     MUST abort the attempt.</t>

  NEW:

    <t>If the lookup result is "insecure", this protocol does
     not apply.  The client SHOULD fall back to its non-DNSSEC,
     non-DANE behavior.  If the SRV lookup fails (including the
     case that the RRset is "bogus"), the client MUST abort its
     to contact the desired service.  </t>

Next (number 4 of section 3.1)

  SRV lookup returns candidate "Transport endpoints", not hostnames,
  mention requirement for secure CNAME/DNAME indirection once more.

  OLD:

    <t>In the successful case, the client now has an authentic list of
     target server host names with weight and priority values. It performs
     server ordering and selection using the weight and priority
     values without regard to the presence or absence of DNSSEC or
     TLSA records. It also takes note of the DNSSEC validation status of
     the SRV response for use when checking certificate names (see
     <xref target="tls"/>). The client can now proceed to making address
     queries on the target server host names as described in the next
     section.</t>

  NEW:

    <t>When the lookup returns a "secure" RRset, perhaps via a
     chain of "secure" CNAME/DNAME records, the client now has an
     authentic list of target transport enpdoints with weight and
     priority values. It performs server ordering and selection
     using the weight and priority values without regard to the
     presence or absence of DNSSEC or TLSA records. It also takes
     note of the DNSSEC validation status of the SRV response for
     use when checking certificate names (see <xref target="tls"/>).
     The client can now proceed to making address queries on the
     target server host names as described in the next section.</t>

This message covers sections 3.2 ("Address Queries") and 3.3 ("TLSA Queries").

General comment (copied verbatim from abstract and introduction
feedback):

    The draft frequently talks about "hostnames", where what is
    really meant is a transport endpoint (port, transport protocol,
    host).  With PKIX-EE or DANE-EE certificate usages, TLSA records

    non-interchangeable key material with distinct services on a
    single host.  So in many places I will be suggesting replacing
    statements about "hostnames" with statements about "transport
    endpoints".

3.2. Address Queries

  Clients that support only v4 or only v6 need not make queries for 
  an address type they can't use.

  OLD:

    <t>For each SRV target server host name, the client makes A and AAAA
     queries, performs DNSSEC validation on the address (A or AAAA) response,
     and continues as follows based on the results:

  NEW:

    <t>For each SRV target server host name, the client makes A and/or AAAA
     queries, performs DNSSEC validation on the address (A or AAAA) response,
     and continues as follows based on the results:

  The term "usable" is not applicable in the context of address
  queries.  TLSA queries should be made if either the A or AAAA
  response is secure (e.g., sometimes the absence of "AAAA" is
  "insecure" due to opt-out, while the "A" records are "secure").

  When the zone containing the host's A/AAAA records is unsigned,
  queries for TLSA are more likely to fail than to unexpectedly
  produce "secure" results.  This is not to say that they are in
  fact likely to "fail".

  OLD:

     <list style="symbols">
      <t>If the response is "secure" and usable, the client MUST perform a TLSA
       query for that target server host name as described in the
       next section.</t>
      <t>If the response is "insecure", the client MUST NOT perform a
       TLSA query for that target server host name; the TLSA query will
       most likely fail.</t>
      <t>If the response is "bogus" or "indeterminate", the client
       MUST NOT connect to this target server; instead it uses the next
       most appropriate SRV target.</t>
    </list></t>

  NEW:

     <list style="symbols">
      <t>If either of the A or AAAA RRsets is "secure", the client MUST
       perform a TLSA query for that target service endpoint as described
       in the next section.</t>
      <t>If both RRsets are "insecure", the client MUST NOT perform a
       TLSA query for that target; such TLSA queries are very
       unlikely to produce "secure" results and have been observed
       to spuriously fail even though no TLSA records are present.</t>
      <t>To defend against downgrade attacks, if address record
       lookup fails (this includes both the "bogus" and RFC 4035
       "indeterminate" validation status) the client MUST NOT
       connect to this target service endpoint; instead it uses the next
       most appropriate SRV target.</t>
    </list></t>

3.3. TLSA Queries

  Perhaps a better split:

  OLD:

    <t>For example, the following SRV record for IMAP (see <xref target='RFC6186'/>)
    leads to the TLSA query shown below:</t>

    <t><figure><artwork><![CDATA[
_imap._tcp.example.com. 86400 IN SRV 10 0 9143 imap.example.net.

_9143._tcp.imap.example.net. IN TLSA ?
     ]]></artwork></figure></t>

  NEW:

    <t>For example, the following SRV record for IMAP (see <xref target='RFC6186'/>)</t>

     ]]></artwork></figure></t>

    <t>leads to the TLSA query shown below:</t>

    <t><figure><artwork><![CDATA[

This message covers 3.4 through the end of the document.

General comment (copied verbatim from abstract and introduction
feedback):

    The draft frequently talks about "hostnames", where what is
    really meant is a transport endpoint (port, transport protocol,
    host).  With PKIX-EE or DANE-EE certificate usages, TLSA records
    are more precise than the Web PKI and can associate different,
    non-interchangeable key material with distinct services on a
    single host.  So in many places I will be suggesting replacing
    statements about "hostnames" with statements about "transport
    endpoints".

3.4. Impact on TLS Usage

   First bullet:

        s/under 4/in 4/

   Third bullet:

        s/If the TLSA response is "bogus" or "indeterminate"/If the TLSA lookup fails/

   perhaps noting that a "secure" or "insecure" NXDOMAIN is not a failure (as in DNS
   error section of SMTP draft).

4.1. SRV records only

  Second paragraph:

    Also mention here that 6125 and reference identifiers don't apply
    with DANE-EE(3) (some folks may not read as far as 4.2)

4.2 TLSA Records:

  The SMTP and OPS drafts have "toned down" the degree to which the
  content of DANE-EE(3) certs is ignored, specifically only the
  hostname and expiration are superseded by DNSSEC.  Other features
  of the certificate (key usage, ...) may still be taken into account.

Material after section 4 is largely fine.

  * Please update smtp-with-dane reference from -05 to -13.

  * Should he XMPP example SRV record really be "_xmpp-client",
    or instead "_xmpp-server"?  Not familiar with XMPP, so please
    pardon my confusion if that's what it is.
